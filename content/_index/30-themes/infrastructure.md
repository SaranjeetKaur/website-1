In the infrastructure space, ReSA co-leads projects on standards and guidelines.

* ReSA is a joint convenor of the [FAIR 4 Research Software Working Group (FAIR4RS WG) ](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg) with the [Research Data Alliance (RDA)](https://www.rd-alliance.org/) and [FORCE11](https://www.force11.org/). FAIR4RS WG is enabling coordination of a range of existing community-led discussions on how to define and effectively apply FAIR principles to research software, to continue to advance the aims of the open science movement.
* ReSA is also leading the development of a **FAIR 4 Research Software Roadmap** to plan a broad integration across the software landscape of the FAIR principles for software (once developed by FAIR4RS WG). Including initiatives in areas such as: indicators, metrics, maturity models and certification; curriculums and competence centres, career profiles and reward structures; certification of FAIR services; interoperability frameworks; identifiers; metadata; and policy change.
