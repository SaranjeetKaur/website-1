ReSA works in the people space to achieve the aim of research software be recognised and valued as a fundamental and vital component of research worldwide. ReSA engagement in this area include:

 * Software landscape analysis taskforce. This task force identified and analysed the research software landscape in 2020. 
 * ReSA is one of the organisations coordinating development of the Research Data Alliance-led Open Science Registry. This registry will support Open Science practices by providing a publicly available, searchable and evidence-based online platform of the intentions and outcomes of ongoing and future policy changes to the research reward and evaluation system.
 * ReSA is part of the AccelNet Proposal: Community of Open Scholarship Grassroots Networks (COSGN) led by the Centre for Open Science. COSGN includes 120 grassroots networks and proposes to formalise governance and coordination of the networks to maximise their impact and establish standard practices for sustainability. If the proposal is successful it will help ReSA in its role facilitating connections and communication across communities by leading an open source working group.
 * In 2021, The Wellcome Trust supports ReSA to host a series of online workshops to facilitate the connection of existing research software initiatives that are concerned with people issues related to skills and training, career paths and recognition frameworks etc. This broader strategic work will guide development of a collaborative approach to solving bottlenecks for careers and training in the research software sector.
