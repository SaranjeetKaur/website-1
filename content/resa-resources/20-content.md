## ReSA Outputs

ReSA outputs can provide useful references to support recognition and valuing of research software as a key component of research. Recent items include:

* [FAIR Principles for Research Software](https://rd-alliance.org/group/fair-research-software-fair4rs-wg/outcomes/fair-principles-research-software-fair4rs-0), 2022.
* [Research software is essential for research data, so how should governments respond?](https://www.researchsoft.org/blog/2021-12/) 2021.
* The **[ReSA People Roadmap](https://www.researchsoft.org/documents/people-roadmap.pdf)** facilitated identification and prioritisation of the major issues related to people (or personnel) challenges faced by the research software community, including research software engineers. 
* [Research software landscape analysis](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3699950) blog post shared by [URSSI](http://urssi.us/blog/2020/03/11/the-research-software-alliance-resa-and-the-community-landscape/), [SSI](http://urssi.us/blog/2020/03/11/the-research-software-alliance-resa-and-the-community-landscape/) and [Netherlands eScience Center](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/the-research-software-alliance-resa-and-the-community-landscape-9b8a6290ebb3), 2020.

## Evidence for the importance of research software

The significant role that software plays in research has been identified in a range of surveys and studies that include the following:

* [Charting the digital transformation of science: Findings from the 2018 OECD International Survey of Scientific Authors (ISSA2)](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/charting-the-digital-transformation-of-science_1b06c47c-en) includes evidence that 25% of research produces new code.
* [The Ecosystem of Technologies for Social Science Research](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/technologies-for-social-science-research) tracks increase in the use of software tools, along with characteristics of key tools. It is noted that whilst many commercial tools are available, the more innovative ones are coming out of academia.
* [The top 100 papers](https://www.nature.com/articles/514550a) analyses the top 100 _Nature_ papers and finds that the vast majority describe experimental methods or software that have become essential in their fields.
* [UK Research Software Survey](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14809) considers responses of 1,000 randomly chosen researchers to show that more than 90% of researchers acknowledged software as being important for their own research, and about 70% of researchers said that their research would not be possible without software.
* [Understanding Software in Research: Initial Results from Examining Nature and a Call for Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06527) reveals that “32 of the 40 papers examined mention software, and the 32 papers contain 211 mentions of distinct software, for an average of 6.5 mentions per paper.”
