# Research institution policies to support research software

The ReSA task force on “Research institution policies to support research software” was established early in 2023 with the following members:

* Michelle Barker (ReSA, Australia)
* Jeremy Cohen, University (Imperial College London, UK)
* Pedro Hernández Serrano (Maastricht University, Netherlands)
* Daniel S. Katz (University of Illinois, US)
* Paula Andrea Martinez (Australian Research Data Commons, Australia)
* Dan Rudmann (Leiden University, Netherlands)
* Hugh Shanahan (Royal Holloway, University of London)




ReSA has created this public database of current and past research software funding opportunities to improve the findability of this important information. Members of the community can add current funding opportunities via this **[short form](https://forms.gle/r4Jw4swUd1SXigZc9)**. Funding opportunities are also posted in our [newsletter](https://www.researchsoft.org/news/), on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@researchsoft), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/researchsoft) and [Slack](https://researchsoft.slack.com/).

This database focuses on funding calls or programs that are **targeted at research software** and/or those who develop and maintain it (such as research software engineers). The database does not include broader funding calls for which research software is one of many options for investment, such as research projects in general, open science, open infrastructure, etc.
