# Research institution policies to support research software


The [ReSA task force](https://www.researchsoft.org/taskforces/) on “Research institution policies to support research software” was established early in 2023 to collect institutional policies for further dissemination as examples and encouragement to increase the value of research software assets worldwide.

We collect policies around research software (or open source software) that govern the creation, maintenance, acquisition, use, distribution and management of software within their environment, as well as to recognise such work. Software policies might cover multiple aspects of management to ensure legal, ethical, and secure use of software, as well as the protection of intellectual property rights, and can discuss how software work is used in hiring, evaluation, and promotion. Sometimes research software is integrated into other policies, such as those focused on open science or research data. Useful resources on policies also include Neil Chue Hong’s Implementation of policies on research software, and Michelle Barker’s Landscape of policies around research software.

The ReSA collection on institutional policies to support research software is open for input of new policies. Please [add your organisation’s policy to it](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YgXG1eSrby8e5wzqYOiOZW6KmJtR-wdBTrjr1_aMtF4/edit#gid=0) 
or if you'd like to join the task force please contact info@researchsoft.org.

For information on national and international policies that support research software, refer to our [listing on the Guidelines page](https://www.researchsoft.org/guidelines/) and [blog post](https://www.researchsoft.org/blog/2021-12/).
