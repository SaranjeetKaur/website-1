# Research institution policies to support research software

## Aim

The [ReSA task force](https://www.researchsoft.org/taskforces/) on “Research institution policies to support research software” was established early in 2023 to collect institutional policies for further dissemination as examples and encouragement to increase the value of research software assets worldwide.

Software policies, which can cover general software, open source software, and research software, refers to a set of guidelines, rules, and regulations established by an organisation around software or research software, meant to govern the creation, maintenance, acquisition, use, distribution and management of software within their environment, as well as to recognise such work. Software policies might cover multiple aspects of management to ensure legal, ethical, and secure use of software, as well as the protection of intellectual property rights, and can discuss how software work is used in hiring, evaluation, and promotion. Many of the policies in this collection are focussed on research software. Some discuss open source software and a few are focussed on licensing software from a commercial perspective. There is also one example when research software is integrated into a Research Data Management Policy under the "Special Considerations for data" section, which includes software as a data type.

Useful resources on policies also include our [blog post](https://www.researchsoft.org/blog/2021-12/) and [listing](https://www.researchsoft.org/guidelines/) of international and national policies, Neil Chue Hong’s Implementation of policies on research software, and Michelle Barker’s Landscape of policies around research software.

The ReSA collection on institutional policies to support research software is open for input of new policies. [Please add your organisation’s policy to it](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YgXG1eSrby8e5wzqYOiOZW6KmJtR-wdBTrjr1_aMtF4/edit#gid=0)
