To help you identify key resources this page highlights those
relevant to each of the ReSA themes: people, policy and
infrastructure. These resources are mostly international
recommendations, reports and guidelines that emphasise best practice.

## People

-   [Understanding Equity, Diversity and
    Inclusion Challenges Within the Research Software
    Community](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350647200_Understanding_Equity_Diversity_and_Inclusion_Challenges_Within_the_Research_Software_Community), 2021.
    Analysis of 2018 survey provides evidence for a lack of diversity
    in the Research Software Engineers community. This paper identifies
    interventions which could address challenges and highlights areas where the community is
    becoming more diverse.

-   ReSA [software landscape analysis](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3699950), 2020. 
    identifies 50+ stakeholders in the research software community and topics of interest, e.g., preservation, RSEs,
    citation, productivity, sustainability. 

-   [What do we know about RSEs?](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2018-03-12-what-do-we-know-about-rses-results-our-international-surveys) 2018. The Software Sustainability Institute analyses results from international
    surveys in 2016, 2017 and 2018 to learn more about RSEs and their work conditions. 

-   [UK Research Software
    Survey](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2014-12-04-its-impossible-conduct-research-without-software-say-7-out-10-uk-researchers), 2014. Analysis highlights the importance of software in conducting research, e.g., that 92% of academics use research software. The dataset is also available. 
     
-   [Database of Diverse Databases](https://editorsofcolor.com/diverse-databases/). Useful for finding speakers for a more equitable world - see listings for "Coding + Tech", "Tech Policy" and "Science".


## Policy

-   [Evidence for the importance of research software](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3884311), 2020. This ReSA analysis
    considers papers relating to meta-research, policy, community,
    education and training, research breakthroughs and
    specific software. 

-   [The top 100 papers](https://www.nature.com/articles/514550a), 2014. 
    Explores the most-cited research of all time to show that the vast majority
    describe experimental methods or software that have become
    essential in their fields.

-   [ReSA Response to US RFI: Public Access to Peer-Reviewed
    Scholarly Publications, Data and Code Resulting From Federally
    Funded Research](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3828148), 2020. Focuses on how improving the recognition and value of research
software can increase the access to unclassified published research, digital scientific
data, and code supported by the US Government.

-   [Charting the digital transformation of science: Findings from the
    2018 OECD International Survey of Scientific
    Authors (ISSA2)](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/charting-the-digital-transformation-of-science_1b06c47c-en), 2020. This paper explores the potential impacts of digitalisation based on a combination of different indicators on research impact, and includes evidence that 25% of research produces new code.
    
-   [The Ecosystem of Technologies for Social Science Research 2020](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/technologies-for-social-science-research).
    Examines the ecosystem of software technologies for social science research. It addresses the challenges facing those who build and use these tools, and looks to the future of technology in social research.
    
-   [Six Recommendations for implementation of FAIR practice by the FAIR
    in practice task force of the European open science cloud FAIR
    working
    group](https://doi.org/10.2777/986252), 2020.
    This report analyses the state of FAIR practices within diverse research communities and FAIR-related policies in different countries and offers six practical recommendations on how FAIR can be turned into practice. It includes a separate section details FAIR practice for digital objects other
    than research data.
        
#### National and regional policies and strategies

-   [Scholarly infrastructures for research software (SIRS): Report
    from the EOSC Executive Board Working Group (WG) Architecture Task
    Force](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/145fd0f3-3907-11eb-b27b-01aa75ed71a1/language-en), 2020. Establishes a set of recommendations to allow the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) to include software, next to other research outputs like publications and data, in the realm of its research artifacts. This work is built upon a survey and documentation of a representative panel of current operational infrastructures across Europe, comparing their scopes and approaches. This report summarises the state of the art, identifies best practices, as well as open problems, and paves the way for federating the different approaches in view of supporting the software pillar of EOSC.
    
-    French [National Plan for Open Science](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/second-national-plan-for-open-science/), 2021. Places software on a par with publications and data in research and Open Science.
