To help you identify key resources this page highlights those
relevant to each of the ReSA themes: people, policy and
infrastructure. These resources are mostly international
recommendations, reports and guidelines that emphasise best practice.

## People

-   [Understanding Equity, Diversity and
    Inclusion Challenges Within the Research Software
    Community](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350647200_Understanding_Equity_Diversity_and_Inclusion_Challenges_Within_the_Research_Software_Community), 2021.
    Analysis of 2018 survey provides evidence for a lack of diversity
    in the Research Software Engineers community. This paper identifies
    interventions which could address challenges and highlights areas where the community is
    becoming more diverse.

-   ReSA [software landscape analysis](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3699950), 2020. 
    identifies 50+ stakeholders in the research software community and topics of interest, e.g., preservation, RSEs,
    citation, productivity, sustainability. [doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3699950](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3699950)

## Policy

-   [Evidence for the importance of research software](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3884311), 2020. This ReSA analysis
    considers papers relating to meta-research, policy, community,
    education and training, research breakthroughs and
    specific software. 
    [doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3884311](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3884311)
-   [The top 100 papers](https://www.nature.com/articles/514550a), 2014. Nature

    describe experimental methods or software that have become
    essential in their fields.

-   [Charting the digital transformation of science: Findings from the
    2018 OECD International Survey of Scientific
    Authors (ISSA2)](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/charting-the-digital-transformation-of-science_1b06c47c-en), 2020. The paper explores the potential impacts of digitalisation based on a combination of different indicators on research impact, and includes evidence that 25% of research produces new code.
    
-   [The Ecosystem of Technologies for Social Science Research 2020](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/technologies-for-social-science-research).
    Using software tools in the research process is of critical
    importance to a majority of social science researchers.
    
-   Six Recommendations for implementation of FAIR practice by the FAIR
    in practice task force of the European open science cloud FAIR
    working
    group 2020.
    A separate section details FAIR practice for digital objects other
    than research data [doi.org/10.2777/986252](https://doi.org/10.2777/986252).

## Infrastructure

-   Nine Best Practices for Research Software Registries and
    Repositories: A Concise Guide (2020) [arXiv
    2012.13117](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13117). Scientific software
    registries and repositories serve various roles in their
    respective disciplines. These resources improve software
    discoverability and research transparency, thereby supporting
    research reproducibility and replicability.

-   Scholarly infrastructures for research software (SIRS): Report
    from the EOSC Executive Board Working Group (WG) Architecture Task
    Force, 2020. Establishes a set of recommendations to allow the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) to include software, next to other research outputs like publications and data, in the realm of its research artifacts. This work is built upon a survey and documentation of a representative panel of current operational infrastructures across Europe, comparing their scopes and approaches. This report summarises the state of the art, identifies best practices, as well as open problems, and paves the way for federating the different approaches in view of supporting the software pillar of EOSC..
