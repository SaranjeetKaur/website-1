To help you identify key resources this page highlights those
relevant to each of the ReSA themes: people, policy and
infrastructure. These resources are mostly international
recommendations, reports and guidelines that emphasise best practice.

## People

-   [Understanding Equity, Diversity and
    Inclusion Challenges Within the Research Software
    Community](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350647200_Understanding_Equity_Diversity_and_Inclusion_Challenges_Within_the_Research_Software_Community), 2021.
    Analysis of 2018 survey provides evidence for a lack of diversity
    in the Research Software Engineers community. This paper identifies
    interventions which could address challenges and highlights areas where the community is
    becoming more diverse.

-   ReSA [software landscape analysis](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3699950), 2020
    [doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3699950](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3699950)
    identifies 50+ stakeholders in the research software community and topics of interest, e.g., preservation, RSEs,
    citation, productivity, sustainability.

-   [What do we know about RSEs?](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2018-03-12-what-do-we-know-about-rses-results-our-international-surveys), 2018. The Software Sustainability Institute analyses results from international
    surveys in 2016, 2017 and 2018 to learn more about RSEs and their work conditions.

-   [UK Research Software
    Survey](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2014-12-04-its-impossible-conduct-research-without-software-say-7-out-10-uk-researchers), 2014. Analysis highlights the importance of software in conducting research, e.g., that 92% of academics use research software. The dataset is also available.

-   FAIR4RS WG subgroup community consultation March 2021 [doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4635410](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4635410)

-   Evidence for the importance of research software. This analysis
    considers papers relating to meta-research, policy, community,
    education and training, research breakthroughs and
    specific software. Produced by The Research Software Alliance (ReSA)
    Taskforce for the importance of research software (2020)
    [*doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3884311*](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3884311)

-   RDA COVID-19 Guidelines and Recommendations (2020). The
    unprecedented spread of the virus has prompted a rapid and massive
    research response with a diversity of outputs that pose a challenge
    to interoperability. To make the most of global efforts these
    guidelines are shared
    [doi.org/10.15497/rda00052](https://doi.org/10.15497/rda00052)

-   Inform approaches for ensuring broad Public Access to Peer-Reviewed
    Scholarly Publications, Data and Code Resulting From Federally
    Funded Research (2020)
    [doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3828148](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3828148)

-   Charting the digital transformation of science: [Findings from the
    2018 OECD International Survey of Scientific
    Authors (ISSA2)](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/charting-the-digital-transformation-of-science_1b06c47c-en). The paper explores the potential impacts of digitalisation based on a combination of different indicators on research impact. The transformation is uneven across fields and sectors, and is influenced by factors such as norms, experience, skills and data availability.

-   [The top 100 papers](https://www.nature.com/articles/514550a). (2014) Nature
    explores the most-cited research of all time. The vast majority
    describe experimental methods or software that have become
    essential in their fields.
    [*https://www.nature.com/articles/514550a*](https://www.nature.com/articles/514550a)

-   [The Ecosystem of Technologies for Social Science Research 2020](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/technologies-for-social-science-research).
    Using software tools in the research process is of critical
    importance to a majority of social science researchers.

-   Six Recommendations for implementation of FAIR practice by the FAIR
    in practice task force of the European open science cloud FAIR
    working
    group 2020.
    A separate section details FAIR practice for digital objects other
    than research data [doi.org/10.2777/986252](https://doi.org/10.2777/986252).

## Infrastructure

-   Nine Best Practices for Research Software Registries and
    Repositories: A Concise Guide (2020) [*arXiv
    2012.13117*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13117). Scientific software
    registries and repositories serve various roles in their
    respective disciplines. These resources improve software
    discoverability and research transparency, thereby supporting
    research reproducibility and replicability.

-   [Scholarly infrastructures for research software (SIRS): Report
    from the EOSC Executive Board Working Group (WG) Architecture Task
    Force
    (TF) 2020. [doi.org/10.2777/28598](https://doi.org/10.2777/28598). It has become
    essential to archive, preserve and share research software to ensure
    its persistence and availability.
