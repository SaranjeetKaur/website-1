Yo Yehudi is a co-founder of Open Life Science (OLS), a not-for-profit organization dedicated to equitable global culture change in research, towards open community-driven principles. OLS over 400 community members across 6 continents and 40+ countries worldwide.

Yoâ€™s research focuses on human aspects of software development and open communities, connecting common threads that a open source research software engineer might encounter: examining mental models of biological data for biologists and bioinformaticians; common factors in open science community sustainability behavior; and qualitative interviews around barriers to sharing and re-using COVID-19-related data.

Prior to this, Yo worked as Open Source Technology Lead (Data for Science and Health) at the philanthropic research funder the Wellcome Trust, as Research Software Engineer and Community Manager at an open source biological data warehouse at the Department of Genetics Cambridge, as senior leadership at an academic spinout software development company, and as a software developer and technologist in industry.
