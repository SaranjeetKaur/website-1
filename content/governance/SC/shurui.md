Shurui Zhou is an Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto. Her research focuses on facilitating distributed and interdisciplinary software teams to build high-quality systems, including but not limited to building better programming environments for software developers, designing better code review and issue tracking systems to facilitate better collaboration among team members, and identifying vulnerabilities from the codebase. She studies and tackles the problems from both technical and social perspectives, especially in the context of modern open-source collaboration forms, Industrial plant software, and interdisciplinary teams when building AI-based systems or scientific software. She also investigates the collaboration challenges for hardware teams, specifically for CAD designers using online collaborative platforms. To achieve her goals, she combines advances in tooling and software engineering principles with insights from other disciplines that study human collaboration, for which she combines and mixes a wide range of research methods.
