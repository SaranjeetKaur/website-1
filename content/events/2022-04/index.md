Would you like to join a conversation on centering diversity, equity and inclusion  at the heart of research software engineering? ReSA is calling for expressions of interest in joining a workshop entitled “Vive la differénce - research software engineers”. This will be a hybrid event with an in-person element from 19-22 April 2022 at the [Lorentz Centre](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/about-us.html) in the Netherlands; and online events from March-May 2022 across different time zones.  This workshop will bring together a wide range of stakeholders who have not previously collaborated, to analyse best practice and available data to identify both research opportunities and solutions to their own local challenges, to create an informal network of champions in this area. 

There are two ways to become involved:

* Apply to participate in the workshop, which has a maximum of 55 participants. Participants can attend remotely or in-person. The deadline for submission is Friday 19 November 2021, and all applicants will be advised of the outcome in December. 
* Sign up to the [ReSA newsletter](https://www.researchsoft.org/news/) to hear more about the online public events from March-May 2022 that will be associated with the workshop, as more details become available.
