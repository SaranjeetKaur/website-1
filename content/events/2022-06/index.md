## About the Research Software Community Forum

The [Research Software Alliance (ReSA)](https://www.researchsoft.org/) is hosting a monthly online community forum for the global research software community. The Research Software Community Forum is open to everyone. Meetings will occur monthly at alternating times to maximise attendance by participants in different time zones.

The Community Forum offers an opportunity for participants to meet and share information. Each monthly call will feature a short talk and follow-up discussion, with the aim of facilitating community consideration about what’s needed next to address particular issues.

The Community Forum aims to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment, and to engage a broad range of participants from across the globe. Meetings utilise [ReSA’s Code of Conduct](https://www.researchsoft.org/code-of-conduct/).
