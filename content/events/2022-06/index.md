## About the Research Software Community Forum

The [Research Software Alliance (ReSA)](https://www.researchsoft.org/) is hosting a monthly online community forum for the global research software community. The Research Software Community Forum is open to anyone. Meetings will occur monthly at 8-hourly alternating times to maximize attendance by participants in different time zones.

The Community Forum offers an opportunity for participants to meet and share information. Each monthly call will feature a short talk and follow-up discussion, with the aim of facilitating community consideration about what’s needed next to address particular issues.

The Community Forum aims to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment, and to engage a broad range of participants from across the globe. Meetings utilize [ReSA’s Code of Conduct](https://www.researchsoft.org/code-of-conduct/).
