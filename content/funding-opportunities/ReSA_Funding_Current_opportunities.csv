Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF),SSF Semiconductor System Design Research Centre Grant (Sweden),https://strategiska.se/en/call-for-proposal/apply-for-ssf-semiconductor-system-design/,11/1/2022,"Sweden. The call “SSF Semiconductor System Design” (SeSyDe) focuses on optimal design of semiconductors through research, innovation, value creation and product differentiation. The research must include a holistic view of semiconductor design, including several design steps (eg chiplets, semiconductor IP blocks, system architecture, algorithms, software) which should also include adaptation of the design to the final system products.","Sweden, Chemistry, Computer science, Engineering sciences, Materials science, Multi-disciplinary",https://strategiska.se/en/call-for-proposals/
