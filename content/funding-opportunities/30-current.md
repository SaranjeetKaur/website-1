The objective is to create the conditions for research in any domain based on open or shared data and software. Project consortia must have partners from at least 3 of the following countries: Belgium, Brazil, Czech Republic, France, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom. This call addresses all research domains. | reuse                                    |
