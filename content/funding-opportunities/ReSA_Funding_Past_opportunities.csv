The goal of the Global Participation Program (GPP) is to help bridge the gap in ORCID uptake in countries which have been designated as having low- and lower-middle-income economies by the World Bank, particularly in the Global South. Grants for Technical Integration, which can be used to fund software development to build and update ORCID integrations in open-source systems that will enable or facilitate participation in ORCID in currently under-represented regions and to support the creation of technical documentation, outreach, and support for resources created through the grants.
