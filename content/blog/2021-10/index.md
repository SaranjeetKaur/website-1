ReSA’s mission is to bring research software communities together to collaborate
 on the advancement of research software. Its vision is to have research software
 recognised and valued as a fundamental and vital component of research worldwide
. Given our mission, there are multiple reasons that it's important for us to
 understand the landscape of communities that are involved with software, in
aspects such as preservation, citation, career paths, productivity, and
sustainability. One of these reasons is that ReSA seeks to be a link between
these communities, which requires identifying and understanding them. We want to
 be sure that there aren't significant community organisations that we don't
 know about to involve in our work. Also, identifying where there are gaps will
 help us create the opportunities and communities of practices as required.
