## Expressions of interest

Are you familiar with the research software initiatives of a geographic region in the Global South, and interested in a few hours of paid work to share that knowledge?

ReSA is updating its [mapping](https://zenodo.org/record/3699950) of the research software community and is seeking short-term contractors who can assist with profiling countries in the Global South. This could include listing of research software initiatives, events, funders, and a short contextual narrative. It is anticipated that this work could be undertaken completely via online research. Contractors will be remunerated up to USD$750 to complete approximately 2 days work by mid-February 2022. Contractors will ideally be located in the geographic area that they will review, or have previously resided there. 

If this sounds like you, then fill out this short [expression of interest](https://airtable.com/shrh1QhvV5REOfiIl). Expressions of interests are welcome from all sections of the community regardless of gender, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, and transgender status. As outlined in the ReSA [Code of Conduct](https://www.researchsoft.org/code-of-conduct/), ReSA welcomes and encourages participation in our community by people of all backgrounds and identities. Applicants must be able to enter into a contract with ReSAâ€™s fiscal sponsor, [Code for Science and Society](https://codeforscience.org/). Please note that unfortunately applications cannot be accepted from the following countries due to restrictions on contracting arrangements: Cuba, Iran, Syria and North Korea.

Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, with an aim to fill positions from mid-December 2021 until mid-January 2022. If you have any questions then please contact the ReSA Director, [Michelle Barker](mailto:info@researchsoft.org).

Context: ReSA's vision is that research software is recognised and valued as a fundamental and vital component of research worldwide. A wide range of research software organisations and programs exist internationally to address the varied challenges in software productivity, quality, reproducibility, and sustainability. As detailed in the [Strategic Plan](https://www.researchsoft.org/documents/Strategic_Plan_2021-23.pdf), ReSA aims to coordinate across these efforts to leverage investments, to achieve the shared long-term goal of research software valued as a fundamental and vital component of research worldwide.
