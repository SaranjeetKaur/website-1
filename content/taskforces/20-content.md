ReSAâ€™s mission is to bring research software communities together to collaborate on the advancement of the research software ecosystem, to achieve the vision that research software and those who develop and maintain it are recognised and valued as fundamental and vital to research worldwide.

To deliver on this mission, we invite the ReSA community to join us on ReSA activities stemming from the [ReSA Strategic Plan](https://www.researchsoft.org/documents/Strategic_Plan_2021-23.pdf)- [comments are welcome](https://github.com/researchsoft/website/discussions/5).

## Community consultations

ReSA community consultations facilitate discussions to identify and prioritise challenges across ReSA's three key themes: people, policy and infrastructure. Community consultations are core ReSA activities, enabling the community to collaborate on elucidating how to advance visibility of research software.

The **[ReSA People Roadmap](https://www.researchsoft.org/documents/people-roadmap.pdf)** community consultation facilitated identification and prioritisation of the major issues related to people (or personnel) challenges faced by the research software community, including research software engineers. The People Roadmap  interviewed 28 research software initiatives to identify strategies and programs across, to identify common issues and priorities.

* Roles/careers/recognition, e.g., Research Software Engineers (RSEs), research software product managers, research software community managers
* Skills needed and provision of training (including resources such as best practice guides)
* Community/team development, including diversity, equity and inclusion
* Policy such as best practice examples relating to personnel issues
* Infrastructure, physical infrastructure and standards in areas such as software citation that support people-themed issues

## Current task forces

ReSA task forces enable the community to focus and identifying challenges and solutions for a particular area, at the international level.

**Aligning publisher policies for sharing code**: This task force builds on the International Data Week session, Sharing code that supports research articles: is it time to align goals and publisher policies? ([agenda](https://www.rd-alliance.org/sharing-code-supports-research-articles-it-time-align-goals-and-publisher-policies), [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wtKgR78PIDbL2tKkyok8UClN4cG7g70NqhccFL4M73o/edit#slide=id.p![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8003204/189754810-4f62c27b-2795-41e5-8402-79f28235f8cc.png)) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIkWpke1lnY&t=1385s)). Started July 2022 and now working towards [RDA plenary 20](https://www.rd-alliance.org/plenaries/rda-20th-plenary-meeting-gothenburg-hybrid) (March 2023) for the next phase of the group. 

**Software landscape analysis**: This task force is now updating its work to include more initiatives from across the globe, which will complete in late 2022. Previous results were presented in this [blog](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3699950) posted by [URSSI](http://urssi.us/blog/2020/03/11/the-research-software-alliance-resa-and-the-community-landscape/), [SSI](http://urssi.us/blog/2020/03/11/the-research-software-alliance-resa-and-the-community-landscape/) and [Netherlands eScience Center](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/the-research-software-alliance-resa-and-the-community-landscape-9b8a6290ebb3) on 11 March 2020. Help us keep the [ReSA list of research software communities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15JHqOxR4HIKHYe821IPvbxIuXP1zMjXKGEIJwB-GPqE/edit#gid=0) up to date by making comments in the spreadsheet.

There are also task forces associaed with the [Research Software Funders Group](https://www.researchsoft.org/taskforces/) focusing on improving coordination of funding, and implementation of the [FAIR4RS Principles](https://www.researchsoft.org/blog/2022-06/).

## Completed task forces

**[FAIR 4 Research Software](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg)** applied the FAIR principles to research software to create the [FAIR4RS Principles](https://www.researchsoft.org/blog/2022-06/), which are now being adopted by a [range of organisations](https://zenodo.org/record/6258366#.YrP-COxBzQ0). This task force was convened in partnership with the [Research Data Alliance (RDA)](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg) and [FORCE11](https://www.force11.org/group/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-working-group). [Join the group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg).

**[FAIR 4 Research Software Roadmap](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6239373)** identified key stakeholders in areas arising from the application of the FAIR principles to research software, to guide strategic planning and investment. Consultation with key stakeholders enabled mapping of existing projects that apply some of the elements of the FAIR principles to research software into a longer-term framework to improve strategic alignment and potential collaborators/leads for parts of the Roadmap. Initiatives progressing particular elements of the Roadmap include:

* [Metrics Working Group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BpzecVx4ZvSNfHD-UHhofZVdA6qiP_ENrmozmiq9zY4/edit) to develop FAIR research software metrics.
* [Life Sciences Working Group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yQun2tObksymOrAV4RY7jqbSkZ0r8G6I-vrkDAGHnnI/edit) to support the implementation of the FAIR4RS principles in the life sciences community, with ELIXIR providing a pilot use case.
* [FAIR for Virtual Research Environments (VREs) Working Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/fair-virtual-research-environments-wg/case-statement/fair-virtual-research-environments-vres) will enable coordination between existing communities working with VREs, science gateways, platforms and virtual labs, to define what it means for VREs to be and enable FAIR, and provide guidance to VRE developers in achieving this.
* [FAIR4RS skills and training curriculums](https://www.rd-alliance.org/skills-and-training-curriculums-support-fair-research-software) aims to coordinate discussion on the opportunity for the training and research software communities to advance identification of FAIR research software skills and curriculums, building on both existing work on research software training for researchers and the growing body of FAIR data work in this area.

**Software sections of [RDA COVID-19 Guidelines and Recommendations](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/rda-covid19-rda-covid19-omics-rda-covid19-epidemiology-rda-covid19-clinical-rda-covid19-1)** for policy makers, funders and the research community. [Final recommendations](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/rda-covid19-rda-covid19-omics-rda-covid19-epidemiology-rda-covid19-clinical-rda-covid19-1) helping COVID-19 stakeholders follow best practices to maximize the efficiency of their work, and to act as a blueprint for future emergencies.

**Evidence for the importance of research software**. This task force presented its outcomes in this [blog](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3884311) posted by [URSSI](http://urssi.us/blog/2020/06/08/evidence-for-the-importance-of-research-software/), [SSI](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2020-06-08-evidence-importance-research-software) and [Netherlands eScience Centre](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/evidence-for-the-importance-of-research-software-1cb4a49077f3) in June 2020. This work identified and analysed resources that demonstrate the importance of research software to research outcomes, to provide information for sharing with key influencers.
