ReSAâ€™s mission is to bring research software communities together to collaborate on the advancement of research software, to achieve the vision of research software being recognised and valued as a fundamental and vital component of research worldwide.

To deliver on this mission, we invite the ReSA community to join us on these task forces:

## Ongoing task forces

* **[FAIR 4 Research Software](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg)** is working to to define and effectively apply FAIR principles to research software, to achieve adoption of these principles, starting from a range of existing community-led discussions. This task force has been convened in partnership with the [Research Data Alliance (RDA)](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg) and [FORCE11](https://www.force11.org/group/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-working-group). [Join the group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg).

* **FAIR 4 Research Software Roadmap** aims to identify key stakeholders in areas arising from the application of the FAIR principles to research software, to guide strategic planning and investment. [Subscribe to the FAIR 4 Research Software Roadmap email list](http://eepurl.com/gY9-vv). Consultation with key stakeholders will enable the following outcomes:
1. Mapping of existing projects that look at applying some of the elements of the FAIR principles to research software into a longer-term framework to improve strategic alignment and potential collaborators/leads for parts of the Roadmap.
2. Identification of opportunities for existing FAIR data initiatives to incorporate a focus on FAIR research software.
3. Identification of Roadmap elements that are specific (or that apply in a different way to) to research software and that have not been covered by FAIR data initiatives.

## Completed task forces

* **Software sections of [RDA COVID-19 Guidelines and Recommendations](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/rda-covid19-rda-covid19-omics-rda-covid19-epidemiology-rda-covid19-clinical-rda-covid19-1)** for policy makers, funders and the research community. [Final recommendations](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/rda-covid19-rda-covid19-omics-rda-covid19-epidemiology-rda-covid19-clinical-rda-covid19-1) helping COVID-19 stakeholders follow best practices to maximize the efficiency of their work, and to act as a blueprint for future emergencies.

* **Evidence for the importance of research software**. This task force presented its outcomes in this [blog](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3884311) posted by [URSSI](http://urssi.us/blog/2020/06/08/evidence-for-the-importance-of-research-software/), [SSI](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2020-06-08-evidence-importance-research-software) and [Netherlands eScience Centre](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/evidence-for-the-importance-of-research-software-1cb4a49077f3) in June 2020. This work identified and analysed resources that demonstrate the importance of research software to research outcomes, to provide information for sharing with key influencers.

* **Software landscape analysis**. This task force identified and analysed the research software landscape in this [blog](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3699950) posted by [URSSI](http://urssi.us/blog/2020/03/11/the-research-software-alliance-resa-and-the-community-landscape/), [SSI](http://urssi.us/blog/2020/03/11/the-research-software-alliance-resa-and-the-community-landscape/) and [Netherlands eScience Center](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/the-research-software-alliance-resa-and-the-community-landscape-9b8a6290ebb3) on 11 March 2020. Help us keep the [ReSA list of research software communities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15JHqOxR4HIKHYe821IPvbxIuXP1zMjXKGEIJwB-GPqE/edit#gid=0) up to date by making comments in the spreadsheet.
