Paula joined the Research Software Alliance in January 2021 to support the growing community of ReSA and the
[FAIR4RS working group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg). Her activities
reflect current emphasis on project management and program development as the community starts to mature. Her part-time
role with ReSA is funded by grants from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Wellcome Trust.

She is also a co-chair of the [FAIR4RS working group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg)
and the Vice Chair of the [Carpentries Executive Council](https://carpentries.org/governance/) where she is developing
strategy and implementation plans to ensure the sustainability and growth of these two endeavours.
Her extensive community work with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), [RLadies Brisbane](https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_brisbane/blob/master/organisersKit/volunteers.md) and [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org), also demonstrates her ability
to triage and prioritise tasks to achieve both personal and professional goals. Paula has experience working across a
broad program of activities and supporting different domains from bioinformatics to social networking. She is used to
working with remote and distributed teams and facilitating collaborations internationally.
