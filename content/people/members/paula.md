Paula joined ReSA in 2021 to support the growing community of ReSA and the
[FAIR4RS working group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg) and ReSA task force. Her input was project management and program development as the community completed its outcomes. Her part-time
role with ReSA is currently supported by the Australian Research Data Commons, and previously by grants from the
Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Wellcome Trust.

She is part of the steering commitee of the [Research Software Engineers Association of Australia and New Zealand](http://rse-aunz.org/) and a co-host of the [Visible Research Software Interest Group](https://sites.google.com/ardc.edu.au/visible-research-software) since 2022. She has also been a Steering Committee member of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), [RLadies Brisbane](https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_brisbane/blob/master/organisersKit/volunteers.md) and [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) maintainer.
Within these communities she develops strategies to support the growth and sustainability of research software.
She demonstrates her ability
to triage and prioritise tasks to achieve both personal and professional goals. She is used to working with remote and distributed teams and facilitating collaborations internationally.
