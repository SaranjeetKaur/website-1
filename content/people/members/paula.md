Paula joined the Research Software Alliance in January 2021 to support the growing community of ReSA and the
[FAIR4RS working group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg). Her activities
reflect current emphasis on project management and program development as the community starts to mature. Her part-time
role with ReSA is supported by the Australian Research Data Commons since July 2022, and previously by grants from the 
Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Wellcome Trust.

She is also a Steering Committee member of the [Research Software Engineers Association of Australia and New Zealand](http://rse-aunz.org/) and a co-host of the [Visible Research Software Interest Group](https://sites.google.com/ardc.edu.au/visible-research-software) since 2022. 
Within these communities she develops strategies to support the growth and sustainability.
Her extensive community work with [FAIR4RS working group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg), [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), [RLadies Brisbane](https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_brisbane/blob/master/organisersKit/volunteers.md) and [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org), also demonstrate her ability
to triage and prioritise tasks to achieve both personal and professional goals. Paula has experience working across a
broad program of activities and supporting different domains from bioinformatics to social networking. She is used to
working with remote and distributed teams and facilitating collaborations internationally.
