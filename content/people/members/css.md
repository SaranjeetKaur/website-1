CS&S partner with leaders across public interest technology through comprehensive fiscal sponsorship. Projects in the fiscal sponsorship program are supported with financial and operational services. Our approach includes strategic support to develop governance, sustainability, and community strategies.

Aliciaâ€™s experience includes operations and knowledge management, HR and recruitment, learning and development, and process design in a variety of non-profit and research organisations. She is passionate about designing transparent, supportive systems and processes that enable knowledge sharing and learning in community. She is a co-founder of the Black Cultural Studies Collective, a Black feminist working group that promotes open knowledge practices and creative methods in research about Black life and culture among artists, academics, librarians, curators and students. Prior to CS&S, Alicia was a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and Brooklyn College.
