Talarify joined ReSA 2023 to support community growth in Africa, with funding by a [grant](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7275397) from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.

The South African-based consulting company has been involved in numerous continental initiatives related to research software, including The Carpentries, Africa R Users, and afrimapr. It has also been engaged in global Research Software Engineering (RSE) initiatives such as the [International RSE Survey](https://github.com/softwaresaved/international-survey), and since 2022 has led [RSSE-Africa](https://rsse.africa) meetups, member showcases, and more. Through their involvement in these initiatives, the Talarify team has learned much about the local communities and has established connections with researchers involved in coding and research infrastructure across the continent.

The Talarify team is Anelda van der Walt (Executive director), Nomalungelo Maphanga (Project manager and data science mentor), and Noxolo Chalale (Marketing and community engagement manager). Anelda has a background in Bioinformatics and 20 years of experience bridging the Global North and South. Noma is qualified as a chemical engineer, codes in Python and R and is growing her research software skills. Noxolo brings expertise from more than ten years in media and digital marketing.
