### Welcome to this template

The [ReSA Taskforce](http://www.researchsoft.org/resa-taskforces-join-us/) on evidence for the
importance of research software presented its outcomes in a [blog](https://zenodo.org/record/3884311#.Xt7-NvJS-lM)
posted by [URSSI](http://urssi.us/blog/2020/06/08/evidence-for-the-importance-of-research-software/),
[SSI](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2020-06-08-evidence-importance-research-software) and
[Netherlands eScience Centre](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/evidence-for-the-importance-of-research-software-1cb4a49077f3)
in early June. This work identified and analysed resources that demonstrate the importance of
research software to research outcomes, to provide information for sharing with key influencers.
This analysis considers papers relating to meta-research, policy, community, education and training, research breakthroughs and specific software.
