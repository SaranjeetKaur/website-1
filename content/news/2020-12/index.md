### ReSA’s three focus areas: Spotlight on policy

ReSA has three main focus areas: policy, people and infrastructure. This month’s newsletter highlights ReSA work in the policy space to achieve the ReSA aim that research software be recognised and valued as a fundamental and vital component of research worldwide. [ReSA taskforces](https://www.researchsoft.org/taskforces/) in this area have achieved outcomes including:

* Development of research software sharing guidelines for policy makers, funders, publishers and researchers for inclusion in the [Research Data Alliance COVID-19 Guidelines and Recommendations](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/rda-covid19-rda-covid19-omics-rda-covid19-epidemiology-rda-covid19-clinical-rda-covid19-1).
* Supporting the inclusion of software in the OECD Committee for Science and Technology Policy recommendations (which will become soft law for OECD member states).
* Engagement with the [UNESCO Open Science consultation](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/consultation). The [first draft of the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/consultation) is now available.

The taskforce on the evidence for the importance of research software completed analysis to support policy discussions in this [blog](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3884311) posted by [URSSI](http://urssi.us/blog/2020/06/08/evidence-for-the-importance-of-research-software/), [SSI](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2020-06-08-evidence-importance-research-software) and [Netherlands eScience Centre](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/evidence-for-the-importance-of-research-software-1cb4a49077f3) in June 2020. This work identified and analysed resources that demonstrate the importance of research software to research outcomes, to provide information for sharing with key influencers.

### ReSA Steering Committee says farewell to Catherine Jones

ReSA would like to thank Catherine Jones for her contributions as a member of the [ReSA Steering Committee](https://www.researchsoft.org/people/). Catherine has served on this committee since its inception two years ago, bringing significant expertise in software engineering and governance of not-for-profit organisations.

In November ReSA called for nominations for new members to join the Steering Committee in 2021 and will be announcing the new committee members shortly.
