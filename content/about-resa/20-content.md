The vision of the Research Software Alliance (ReSA) is that research software and those who develop and maintain it are recognised and valued as fundamental and vital to research worldwide.

A [wide range](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08473) of research software organisations and programs exist internationally to address the varied challenges in
software productivity, quality, reproducibility, and sustainability. ReSA aims to coordinate across these efforts to leverage investments, to achieve shared goals. The [ReSA Strategic Plan](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1Ez2b2Gj6U3Z99fWCoX5K9uOsNLiV5Coo) provides details. The [ReSA engagement plan for 2021](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QfjwVlrwCrIM8GKcsbR7HVmIGgQXCKcX/view) contains more information on how community engagement occurs.

ReSA aims to achieve this through:

* Promoting the inclusion of software as a first-class research output
* Improving the ecosystem of research software from the technology through to the social structures that support it
* Influencing decision makers to value research software and the people who develop it.

ReSA is a fiscally sponsored project of [Code for Science & Society](https://codeforscience.org/).

Members of the ReSA community are expected to adhere to the ReSA [Code of Conduct](https://www.researchsoft.org/code-of-conduct/).
