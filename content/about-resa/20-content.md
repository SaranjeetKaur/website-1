The vision of the Research Software Alliance (ReSA) is that research software is recognised and valued as a fundamental
and vital component of research worldwide.

A [wide range](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08473) of research software organisations and programs exist internationally to address the varied challenges in
software productivity, quality, reproducibility, and sustainability.

ReSA aims to coordinate across these efforts to leverage investments, to achieve the shared long-term goal of research
software valued as a fundamental and vital component of research worldwide.

ReSA aims to achieve this through:

* Promoting the inclusion of software as a first-class research output
* Improving the ecosystem of research software from the technology through to the social structures that support it
* Influencing decision makers to value research software and the people who develop it.
