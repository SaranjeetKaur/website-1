[Software is pervasive in modern research](resources/), enabling the generation, analysis and/or presentation of research outputs. Research software is a key driver of innovation and the economy. ReSA focuses on software that is developed to serve a research purpose, rather than the standard software that some researchers also use for research purposes.

While software has started to be recognised internationally as a key part of facilitating trusted, reproducible research outputs and open science, recognition of research software as a valuable research input and output has lagged behind that of research data.

A lot still needs to be done to influence culture change towards research software across a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including researchers, institutions, funders, and publishers, and to develop and promote standards for developing research software that meets the needs of reliable, reproducible, and reusable research.
